# Word-Guess-Game

In this repository I've created a word guessing or "hangman" type game for my UW bootcamp course. The purpose of this assignment was to build a game using JavaScript.

Although the design and layout of the game has not been completed yet the overall theme is cars or more specifically different car manufacturers. The game tracks your wins/losses and you have 8 guesses to guess a specific car manufacturer. You have to guess between Honda, Toyota, Mazda, BMW, Lexus, Mercedes, Fiat, Nissan, Ford or Dodge. 

This game has definitly improved my familiarity with JavaScript but there is still much to learn. I had to use a ton of outside resources to complete this assignment. 

I, David Steger am the only contributer to this repository.

Enjoy playing!
